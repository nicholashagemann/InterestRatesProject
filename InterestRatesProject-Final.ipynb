    "# Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering\n",
    "Here, I clean my data into a format that will be a suitable input for modeling. I get rid of columns with high cardinality or a cardinality of 1, excessive NaN values, as well as all the columns containing leaky information. The leaky variables were variables in the dataset available after the loan had been approved - had I not gotten rid of them, my model would have had much greater predictive power (I tested this for myself but running the same analyses without a fully wrangled dataframe - that analysis is not included here) but it would have been a *useless* model since the majority of the predictive power would have come from columns like the 'grade' and 'subgrade' columns describing how likely the bank thought the applicant was to pay back the loan, which is very tightly correlated with the interest rate. The more risky a loan is for the bank, the higher interest they will charge on it.\n",

    "\n",
    "By having the MAE, R^2, and Time for each hyperparameter I can know which hyperparameter I will use in my final model while also learning which hyperparameter will be suitable for tuning other hyperparameters - i.e. for my final model I will use the hyperparameter with the lowest MAE and highest R^2, but when tuning the other hyperparameters I will use a value which has a MAE and R^2 *similar* to the best but not as time-expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "I choose not to use a GridSearch for the hyperparameters since I am attempting to optimize every hyperparameter and the exponential increase in the time it would take to train my model is not worth the small amount of additional certainty I would gain from knowing I've found the absolute best combination - also, I am sure from past experience with exactly this problem that the increase in accuracy from a GridSearch would be very small compared to the overall increase in accuracy gained through my method (which itself is still small compared to the accuracy of the model itself). \n",
    "\n",
    "In going through each model, I also choose the order in which I optimize hyperparameters very deliberately. I start with hyperparameters that will have the greatest effect on the accuracy and then move to hyperparameters with smaller effects - in essence, ordering them so that the later hyperparameters do not affect the earlier hyperparameters.

    "After testing out decision trees, random forests, boosted random forests, linear regression, and ridge regression, I found that the boosted model gave the lowest MAE and highest R^2 by a significant amount. Given this information, I decided to retrain every hyperparameter instead of assuming that overlapping parameters with other models like max_depth would have the same optimized value. "
